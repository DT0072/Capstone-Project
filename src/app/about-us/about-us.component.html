         <h3 class="text-center">About Penang</h3>
         <p class="mt-4">Penang is a vibrant State with its capital, George Town, having the rare distinction of being a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
            It is a true melting pot of cultures with its blend of Eastern and Western influences. Retaining many of the values adopted 
            during its era of British rule, Penang bears a charm that is unique to itself.</p>

         <h3 class="text-center">About Georgetown</h3>
         <p class="mt-4">Georgetown is the colorful and multicultural capital of the Malaysian island of Penang. Once an important 
            trading center in the Straits of Malacca, the city is known for its British colonial architecture, Chinese 
            stores and mosques. Beyond the old town, Georgetown is a modern city with skyscrapers and shopping malls. 
            The lush Penang Hill, with its hiking and cable car railroad, overlooks it all.</p>
