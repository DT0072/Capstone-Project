        <h4>Kek Lok Si</h4>
        <p>Part of this temple is currently under construction, but if you don't mind a bit of scaffolding, then head on up to 
           Air Itam for the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia. Cultural Buddhism makes itself transparent here — mythical dragons, 
           Chinese goddesses, and small Buddha figurines line the walls, ceilings and walkways in this complex of temples.</p>

        <h4>Unknown Café & Bistro @ Pahang Road, Georgetown, Penang</h4>
        <p>Unknown Cafe has a nice classy interior which is comfortable for a dine in. Most of the table here is small making it 
           suitable for small group of friends or family. I like how the interior look so white and modern.</p>
