                <h3 class="text-center">About Penang</h3>
                <p class="mt-4">Penang is a vibrant State with its capital, George Town, having the rare distinction of being a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
                    It is a true melting pot of cultures with its blend of Eastern and Western influences. Retaining many of the values adopted 
                    during its era of British rule, Penang bears a charm that is unique to itself.</p>

                    stores and mosques. Beyond the old town, Georgetown is a modern city with skyscrapers and shopping malls.
