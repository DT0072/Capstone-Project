            <p class="mt-3">A word of caution if this will be your first time trying this dish - it doesn't appeal to everyone and takes 
                some getting used to. Personally, I don't like it but my partner and our friends did. The dining environment 
                is not attractive, clean or comfortable either. Because this is a hawker stall at the edge of a busy road.

                However, if you are a fan of kway chap or just have a curious appetite, the broth is thick and flavorful. 
                The dish has duck meat, braised eggs and various pig parts according to preference (e.g., pork intestines or 
                pig ears). Other food that we recommended here are char koay teow, loh bak and fried oysters with egg (oh chien).

            <p>Coming to Penang, it is often common to find dessert pop-up stalls by the roadside to cater for the need and 
                convenience of passersby who somehow desire for something to quench their thirst under the hot weather. 
                If you have not heard of it yet, the Penang Famous Teo Chew Cendol is one of the extremely mainstream places 
                for all to go to enjoy bowls of refreshing goodness.„ÄÅ
                <br><br>
                More known for its cendol served till the brim in a blue bowl, the combination of toppings together that 
                consist of served ice, pandan-flavoured jelly, red beans and coconut milk is just right for anybody that 
                comes around. It is not too sweet or bland and together with brown sugar, you have gotten a bowl of enlivening 
                dessert.
